I have just started learning the basics of html following "The Odin Project". I have learned the different usages of strings to make a very basic website, set up a github acount and have improved my knowledge on the fundamentals. By the end of this project I will have further understanding on Website design and more confidence using linux terminal, Git commands, and using html.

Added "index.html", "recipes" directory containing "katsu-curry.html", "pancakes.html" and "pork-tenderloin.html" which I forgot to push to github yesterday. Created link: https://github.com/Max427/odin-recipes.git
