I have just started learning the basics of html following "The Odin Project". I have learned the different usages of strings to make a very basic website, set up a github acount and have improved my knowledge on the fundamentals. By the end of this project I will have further understanding on Website design and more confidence using linux terminal, Git commands, and using html.
