<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</strong></li>
    <li><strong>1/2 cup of olive oil</strong></li>
    <li><strong>2 pounds pork tenderloin</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

    <li>Mix bread crumbs and olive oil in bowl to reach consistency that would be moist enough to stick to the meat when pressed. Place pork on a shallow cooking sheet. Press the crumb mixture onto all sides of the meat until there is no pink showing, usually 1/4 inch thick.</li>

    <li>Bake for at least 35 minutes until a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C) or until there is no pink when the pork is cut. Let the pork rest for 10 minutes, then cut into 1/2 inch slices.</li>
</ol>
